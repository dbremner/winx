== WYSIWYG(Visual) GUI development platform ==

WinxGui focus the goal: MOST SIMPLE BUT EFFECTIVE. To be an WYSIWYG(Visual) GUI development platform is the most important target. For information about what WinxGui have done for visual GUI development, see [VisualGuiDev].

There is a non-official visual GUI development tool named [FreeCode]. It is a addin of Visual Studio 6.0 / Visual Studio 2005. The contributors of FreeCode are QWL1996, who wrote the initial version (a addin of Visual Studio 6.0), and fox1996, who ported FreeCode to Visual Studio 2005.

The following are our plans of VisualGuiDev:
	# Collect feedbacks from FreeCode users to improve it.
	# Collect requirement(feature list) of VisualGuiDev.
	# Provide the official WYSIWYG(Visual) GUI development platform, maybe based on FreeCode.
	

== Porting WINX to multi platforms ==

WinxGui is an _EFFECTIVE_ GUI library. Here _EFFECTIVE_ mainly means to minimize size of the executable programs. And second, we focus how fast the programs run.

Why should WinxGui be _EFFECTIVE_? WinxGui aims to mobile GUI development markets. There are a great variety of brands and models of mobile. C/C++ are flexible and have the strongest ability to fit new platforms. Someone may think java is a better choice, but I don't think so. Java is good. But java isn't the best way of embedded system development(including mobile of course).

The following are our plans of porting WinxGui:
	# Port WinxGui to WinCE.
	# Port WinxGui to Symbian OS series(eg. Nokia S60).
	# Port WinxGui to Linux.
	

== WINX Manuals & Examples ==

The following are our plans:
	# Enrich this wiki. including developer manual references and technique articles covering the most popular problems.
	# Provide more [Tutorials] and [Samples].
	# Provide non-english verion documents, including [http://wiki.winxgui.cn/ Chinese Wiki].
